         <Description>Craftworx is a light overhaul mod with a focus on building and crafting. 

	What this mod includes so far:

		* Increased stack sizes for many items
		* Larger backpack
		* Flaming crossbow bolts, learned from a recipe out in the wilderness
		* Scrap arrows, for when you have lots of scrap iron but few stones
		* Scrap tools - shiv, axe, pick and shovel
		* The turd launcher is, of course, in here
		* Poop is back in the toilets for the turd launcher
		* Additional junk items for most resources
		* New perks - Lockpicking and Tailor Made (for making clothing)
		* Adobe and adobe blocks, back from previous versions of the game
		* Harvesting the lantern, construction lights, and box flashlights from POIs (just destroy them to gain the items)
		* Beakers craftable in the forge
		* Lockpicking safes and some doors (more door types to come at a later date)
		* Quieter lockpicking with better sounds
		* Trees have a chance to drop feathers and eggs
		* Cars have a chance to harvest wheels with the wrench
		* Some loot containers now self-destruct on close
		* Impact wrench, for upgrading metal blocks
		* Functional water cooler - dispenses murky water, and has a large storage space as well
		* Boiled meat, baked potatoes, and Corn on the Cob no longer require the Master Chef perks
		* Paraffin and refined coal, new fuels for burning
		* Level gates on crafting skills are now gone (Ignore the mouseover text)
		* Crossbow reload time reduced to make it more useful
		* More opportunities to harvest brass things in the wilderness
		* Craftable jail doors and bars at the workbench (static for the time being)
		
		More to come as development of the mod continues...
