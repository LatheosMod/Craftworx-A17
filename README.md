Craftworx A17

Craftworx, a 7 Days to Die overhaul mod, updated for A17.4 Stable.

This is the current release version of the mod. It is not complete, as there are a number of things I still need to update and add, but it is currently playable and relatively stable. 

This mod includes the work of the following:

- Sirillion - SMX UI Mod, and a great deal of coding help
- Khaine - lockpicking, pick up harvestable plants, coding support
- Guppycur - Guppy's Placeable Light Mod
- JaxTeller718 - Junk Items (from A16)
- Sphereii - Much, MUCH help in coding
- Elucidus - Impact Wrench, Quality Level Reduced Stamina Loss and Effectiveness Bonus

Craftworx now uses the xpath system for modifying the game, which is a departure from how things were done in previous builds of 7DtD. What this means for the player is that the vanilla config files aren't overwritten, with the exception of the localization.txt file. This has the benefit of making the mod more robust in the event of code changes by The Fun Pimps. 

What you can expect to be included so far:
- Increased stack sizes for many items
- Larger backpack
- Flaming crossbow bolts, learned from a recipe out in the wilderness
- Scrap arrows, for when you have lots of scrap iron but few stones
- Scrap tools - shiv, axe, pick and shovel
- The turd launcher is, of course, in here
- Poop is back in the toilets for the turd launcher
- Additional junk items for most resources
- New perks - Lockpicking and Tailor Made (for making clothing)
- Adobe and adobe blocks, back from previous versions of the game
- Harvesting the lantern, construction lights, and box flashlights from POIs (just destroy them to gain the items)
- Beakers craftable in the forge
- Lockpicking safes and some doors (more door types to come at a later date)
- Trees have a chance to drop feathers and eggs
- Cars have a chance to harvest wheels with the wrench
- Some loot containers now self-destruct on close
- Impact wrench, for upgrading metal blocks
- Functional water cooler - dispenses murky water, and has a large storage space as well
- Boiled meat, baked potatoes, and Corn on the Cob no longer require the Master Chef perks
- Paraffin and refined coal, new fuels for burning
- Level gates on crafting skills are now gone (Ignore the mouseover text)
- Crossbow reload time reduced to make it more useful
- More opportunities to harvest brass things in the wilderness
- Craftable jail doors and bars at the workbench (static for the time being)

On the list for getting added in the future:
- Signature weapons, such as Aviary's Lawbreaker, Red's Specs, and others
- Carbon steel, and the tools/weapons that are crafted from it
- Turd Mortar
- Repeating crossbow
- Changes to the schematics and magazines to make them less annoying
- Various weapon/armor mods
- And lots more...

Installing the mod:

Download the archive, then unpack and copy Data and Mod folders from Craftworx-master into your \Steam\SteamApps\common\7 Days To Die\, and the files will go where they need to go.

While designed for single player games, the mod *should* work on servers with a minimum of hassle.
